# EDA-video-games-sales-1980-2016

- This is a personal project for the online course [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas) by **Jovian**.
- In this project, I used Python open-source libraries `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `opendatasets` and `os`.
- As a learner of data analysis/data science and also a video game player, I choose the video games sales dataset to perform exploratory data analysis. Besides I need a close-to-business-world dataset to practice my Python skills, I thought this topic would be interesting and I was also excited to find some insights into video games and related businesses. 
- I would like to take this project as a showcase of my Python analysis skills. And at the same time, I would love to hear questions, comments, ideas, or feedback from readers.
