# EDA-video-games-sales-1980-2016

- This is a personal project for the online course [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas).
- In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis and data visualization to the cumulative global and regional unit sold for video games that were released from 1980 to 2016. And also analyzed with other variables including genres, platforms, year of release, developers, publishers, and Metacriticâ€™s scores. 
- I used Python open-source libraries `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `opendatasets` and `os`. 
- As a learner of data analysis/data science and also a video game player, I choose the video games sales dataset to perform exploratory data analysis. Besides I need a close-to-business-world dataset to practice my Python skills, I thought this topic would be interesting and I was also excited to find some insights into video games and related businesses. 
- I would like to take this project as a showcase of my Python analysis skills. And at the same time, I would love to hear questions, comments, ideas, or feedback from readers.
